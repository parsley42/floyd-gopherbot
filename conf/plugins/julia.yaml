## Example plugin configuration file showing most configurable items.

## NOTE: If you're modifying the configuration of an existing Gopherbot
## plugin, configured items merge with the default config, and arrays are
## replaced. To add e.g. Help entries, copy the original help entries and
## then add your own.

## Compiled-in go plugins can be disabled
Disabled: false
## When true, this plugin can be activated by direct message. Normally
## plugins can only be used in a given channel for auditing/transparency.
AllowDirect: true
## On the other hand, some plugins may need sensitive information that should
## only be available in a direct message.
DirectOnly: false
## For robots with many plugins, it's useful to have some that are only
## available in certain channels. Maybe the bug search plugin is only available
## in the #bugfixing channel
#Channels: [ "aws", "golang" ]
## Some plugins, like 'ping', are nice to have in all channels
AllChannels: false
## Most plugins that are limited to certain users will have an explicit list
## of allowed users, but a plugin can also be configured for Administrators
## only. Gopherbot may eventually get a more granular permissions system
## if needed, but for now none is planned.
RequireAdmin: false
## To limit access to a plugin to specific users, list there usernames
#Users: [ "alice", "bob", "carol" ]
## You can require users to be members of a group
#Authorizer: groups
## For groups, the AuthRequire is the name of the group
#AuthRequire: monkeys
## When help <keyword> is requested, the robot will spit out the items in
## Helptext. By convention, commands that must be directed at the robot
## start with "(bot),"
Help:
- Keywords: [ "hello", "julia" ]
  Helptext:
  - (bot), hello julia - Runs the trivial Julia hello, world
# - (bot), <some command> - <description of what the command does>
## Command matches can be matched when the user addresses the robot directly,
## either in a direct message, or by giving it's name or alias. The Regex
## is a Go regular expression, easily developed by using the tool at:
## https://regex-golang.appspot.com/assets/html/index.html
CommandMatchers:
- Regex: '(?i:hello julia)'
  Command: hello
